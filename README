Project 2 - Zachary Atkins

Instructions:
This project uses Shader Storage Buffer Objects, so it will not run on Mac. 

To run first run `make`, then run `./main demo.surfs` for a demo surface. Should be that easy.
See the help tooltip at the top of the edit menu for specific selection/ dragging modifiers.
Curves are only loosely supported, and may be buggy and/or cause crashes. 

This project relies on Dear ImGui. See https://github.com/ocornut/imgui for more information. 
No installation should be necessary, as the required ImGui source files are compiled and dynamically linked.
